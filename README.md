The Calendar class is mainly working so far. From here, we will have to start
working on a class to keep track of finances. The goal is to keep track of
spending of a period of time, then keep track of averages over a certain time,
then use that to determine expenses of each type per day/week/month/year.

If I spent $45 on food one day, then a week later buy $45 again, then the
average for one week would be $45 (assuming that I didn't have any food left).

Finding the average amount I would be spending on a specific thing would
be to find how often I rebuy this type to replace it.

TODO:
Add tests for:

Add functionality:
    For testing, add ability to verbose testing results and what is being tested

Something to Think on:
    Given how much spent over time figure out the average spending, ignoring
    how much in stock is left over.
