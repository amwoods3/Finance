This is an under development application that I hope to use for helping me with
keeping track of my finances. It is at the mere beginning stages, so there isn't
much here, but hopefully I can get this application working well and have
something to use. Unfortunately, I don't have many people who are available or
able to work on this with me, so it is pretty much a solo project.
